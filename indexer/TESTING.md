### Testing
To test both my indexer.c and indextest.c, I wrote a testing.sh program which runs through a couple of tests and some errors. In order to correctly test the cases, you need to create the directory "wiki" by crawler.c in the crawler folder. To test the non-writtable file, make a file "fail" and make it unwrittable.

### Test run
An example of the test run is 'testing.out' which was built by 'make test &> testing.out'.
To test in the console simple just run 'make test'.
