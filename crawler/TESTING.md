### Testing
To test my crawler I wrote the test program testing.sh which runs through a couple of tests and some exit errors.
In order to correctly test the cases, you first have to create 3 directories: 'letters', 'wiki', and 'toscrape'.
The test program runs through the letters link, then the wikipedia link. After it tests 3 exit cases and finishes with testing the toscrape link.

### Test run
An example of the test run is 'testing.out' which was built by 'make test &> testing.out'.
To test in the console simple just run 'make test'.
