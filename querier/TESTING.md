### Testing
To test querier.c I wrote a testing.sh file which uses fuzzyquery.c to input 100 different examples and outputed that to testing.out.
In order to run, ../crawler/wiki needs to exist and ../indexer/output. The first has the output from cralwer and the latter has the index from indexer.

## Test run
An example of the test run is 'testing.out' which was built by 'make test &> testing.out'.
To test in the console simple just run 'make test'.
